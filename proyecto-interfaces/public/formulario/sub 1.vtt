xile 2 is going into Early Access in

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.080
around 2 weeks on December the 6th but

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.600
even though it's early access this isn't

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.800
just some small test the game is huge in

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.240

Gameplay

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:28.199

beauty

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:31.639
precious but

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:40.960
impermanent life and death are mortal

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:45.520
enemies and yet bound to one

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:49.319
another the continuation of Life must be

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.319
protected at all

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:56.199
costs some have

00:05:52.319 --> 00:06:00.240

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:01.919
brutal to this I say

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:07.360
there can be no

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:07.360

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.240
a completely different game they're

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:34.280
going for a different they're going to

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.879
both make poe2 and poe1 at the same time

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:41.160
for two different styles of

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:41.160

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:48.520

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:53.159
big game it's actually been 5 years

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:55.199
since we announced pee2 and over that

00:07:53.159 --> 00:07:57.560
time we' revealed a lot but it's been in

00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:59.120
bits and pieces it's pretty hard to keep

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.879
track of it all so today we're going to

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.159

00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:04.360
that will be available at the start of

00:08:02.159 --> 00:08:05.840

been free from any sources of corruption

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:20.280
but the count of augum tempted by

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:23.400
Promises of power intends to harness it

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:26.919
once more the dead are rising monsters

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:28.879
are mutating and Madness is spreading

00:08:26.919 --> 00:08:30.759
under the dark influence of corruption

00:08:28.879 --> 00:08:33.960
the count calls out sentences of death

00:08:30.759 --> 00:08:33.960
to any who would question

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.940

two areas are the same

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:33.000

[Music]

control is there a YouTube stream first

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:43.600
you need to pick a

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:45.519
class now Early Access will initially

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:48.600
have six classes available they don't

00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:50.920
have a yoube stream the monk is a fast

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.440
and furious melee fighter he dashes in

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.360
and out of combat and his mechanics

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:57.640
involve building up and keeping

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:59.760
momentum like all classes in P2 want to

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:03.160
use a wide variety

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.160
internet man

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:13.480
[ __ ] oh I feel so

00:10:10.959 --> 00:10:15.760
bad can they restart the broadcast you

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:17.440
will first need to find skill gems using

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.200
a skill gem will open the gem cutting

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:23.680
menu which shows all the active skills

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.680
available in P2 you can choose an

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.040
existing they have an overlay for

00:10:26.839 --> 00:10:29.620
technical

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:32.360
difficulties br

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:34.760
[Laughter]

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.959
brilliant good stuff honestly rather

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:40.000
than keeping the show going which most

00:10:36.959 --> 00:10:42.360
people would this is a good call sit

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.040
back dial it back let the internet the

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:47.079
New Zealand internet let the New Zealand

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:49.480
internet settle you

00:10:47.079 --> 00:10:51.600
know streaming on YouTube wouldn't make

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:53.959
a difference by the way this is clearly

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:57.120
a this this is obviously a dropping

00:10:53.959 --> 00:10:58.880
frames issue like I've seen this I mean

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:01.800
I see all I see this all the time when

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:03.240
you're in is just dropping your frames

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.440
are skipping your frames are dropping

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.120
and then you can't do anything so it'd

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.800
be the same thing on YouTube they kind

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:10.120
of just need to wait until their

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:12.839
internet's kind of

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:15.279
stable and then load it back up is there

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:18.600
a promotion with Prime look at how many

00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:23.079
prime Subs there are this is

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:23.079
insane holy

00:11:25.639 --> 00:11:30.720
[ __ ] holy [ __ ]

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:38.079
could the subs be making it lag no no

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.360
that's not possible their internet's

00:11:38.079 --> 00:11:40.160
just having technical difficulties

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.560
that's

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.959
all it looks like it's fixed now though

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.279
they're going to probably give it like a

00:11:43.959 --> 00:11:47.480
solid minute or two to see if they're

00:11:46.279 --> 00:11:50.440
dropping any frames and then they're

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:52.240
kind of get back to it oh look how many

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:55.279
people are sponsored and stuff on my

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:58.920

00:11:55.279 --> 00:12:02.320
man that's okay these things happen it

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.320
sucks when they happen but you get

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:10.600
by drops enabled maybe that's why I kind

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:14.760
of want to sub myself oh I'm already

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:14.760
subscribed I think someone gifted me a

00:12:16.959 --> 00:12:22.000
sub how do I make it dark mode

bosses no two areas are the

00:13:16.959 --> 00:13:21.519
same it falls to you to track down the

00:13:19.519 --> 00:13:22.560
seed of corruption the source of all

00:13:21.519 --> 00:13:24.440
this

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:26.399
Devastation on the way you'll face

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:29.160
fearsome Monsters Meet strange

00:13:26.399 --> 00:13:31.199
characters Forge unlikely bonds and

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.040
cover lost

00:13:31.199 --> 00:13:35.279
civilizations but first you'll need to

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:37.920
pick a class

00:13:35.279 --> 00:13:39.800
yes now Early Access will initially have

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:43.199
six classes available let's have a look

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:45.360
at them the monk is a fast and furious

00:13:43.199 --> 00:13:46.720
melee fighter he dashes in and out of

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.279
combat and his mechanics that involve

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:51.160
building up and keeping

00:13:48.279 --> 00:13:52.800
momentum like all classes in po2 you'll

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:55.600
want to use a wide variety of skills to

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:58.000
mix and match different

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.839
combos to get new skills you will first

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.480
need to find skill gem

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:03.199
using a skill gem will open the gem

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:05.800
cutting menu which shows all the active

00:14:03.199 --> 00:14:07.759
skills available in poe2 you can choose

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:10.120
an existing skill to level up or choose

00:14:07.759 --> 00:14:12.279
to engrave a new one since this is a

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.880
level seven skill gem even if you pick a

00:14:12.279 --> 00:14:15.759
new skill it will immediately be level

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:18.759
seven so there's no harm on trying out

00:14:15.759 --> 00:14:21.199
something new the monk primarily uses

00:14:18.759 --> 00:14:22.759
the cter staff there are three skools of

00:14:21.199 --> 00:14:25.240
martial arts

00:14:22.759 --> 00:14:27.040
lightning

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.920
ice and

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:31.320
wind but don't think you have to stick

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:34.160
to just one the best combos are going to

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:36.440
involve mixing elements of all three fun

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.920
let's try killing Palm like many monk

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:40.120
skills this can be used to quickly take

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:42.040
advantage of a specific situation if

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.680
there's an enemy on low life you can use

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:45.839
killing Palm to dash to them and kill

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:47.839
them instantly this will provide a power

00:14:45.839 --> 00:14:49.600
charge then we can use a different skill

00:14:47.839 --> 00:14:52.240
to consume that power charge for a much

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:54.720
more devastating attack the monk also

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:56.600
has powerful combo skills Tempest Bell

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:59.079
for example is a skill that places a

00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:00.800
giant resonating Bell hitting the Bell

00:14:59.079 --> 00:15:03.000
causes it to ring dealing damage to All

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.600
Enemies around it you can also do things

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.759
like freeze or shock the Bell which will

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:09.120
add Elemental damage to the

00:15:06.759 --> 00:15:11.320
strikes the monk also has a variety of

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:12.839
abilities to empower his staff if an

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:15.279
enemy is close to being stunned you can

00:15:12.839 --> 00:15:16.759
use staggering Palm to punch them down

00:15:15.279 --> 00:15:18.160
after that any attack you do will shoot

00:15:16.759 --> 00:15:21.600
out wind

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:24.120
projectiles no flasks flasks flasks not

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:26.160
classes flasks so this just scratches

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:27.800
the surface of the options that you have

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.680
by ing game you'll be dashing from pack

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:31.360
to pack spewing projectiles and

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:33.480
obliterating screens of enemies with

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:36.000
huge combo

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:37.839
attacks you don't need a Pio a style of

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.800
Mele that's a little slow but much

00:15:37.839 --> 00:15:42.920
harder than the warrior is he pounds the

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.399
ground with big chunky attacks and shrug

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:46.839
off the hits of small enemies with large

00:15:44.399 --> 00:15:49.240
amounts of armor even though the mace

00:15:46.839 --> 00:15:51.120
Slams are slow you never lose control

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:53.040
longer attacks can be retargeted as you

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:56.319
go and if you find yourself committed to

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:58.600
a long attack Dodge all out of it at any

00:15:56.319 --> 00:16:00.639
time among the skill option for maces

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.880
you'll find a variety of slams fire

00:16:00.639 --> 00:16:05.120
attacks war cries and shield

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:07.480
skills here I'm going to slam the ground

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:09.040
rening it apart with lines of fire any

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:11.160
slam skill will then cause these fishes

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.519
to erupt with lava I can even run

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:15.000
through them with a skill like Stampede

00:16:12.519 --> 00:16:18.079
to do huge amounts of

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.000
damage that's the warrior can also doing

00:16:18.079 --> 00:16:21.000
interesting gaml

00:16:22.279 --> 00:16:29.240
style it seems more stamp counts as a

00:16:25.639 --> 00:16:30.800
slam more

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:33.319
if you want to go a little faster and be

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:35.519
a little more defensive equip a shield

00:16:33.319 --> 00:16:37.560
in pee2 you can raise your Shield at any

00:16:35.519 --> 00:16:38.480
time to block all damage from the front

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.720
even

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.560
spells while holding up your Shield your

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:45.040
stun meter will build as you take damage

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:48.079
so be careful if it reaches 100% your

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:50.199
stance will break and you will be

00:16:48.079 --> 00:16:52.000
vulnerable some enemies also have

00:16:50.199 --> 00:16:54.240
unblockable attacks which are indicated

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.800
by this red flash if you see one of

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.920
these coming make sure to dodge out of

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:59.399
the

00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:01.040
way using a shield or Al gives you

00:16:59.399 --> 00:17:02.800
access to Shield skills like Shield

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:05.480
charge which allows you to charge

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:07.360
towards enemies and St them while

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:09.880
charging you're also blocking the whole

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:12.480
you damage from the

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:14.520
front the warrior also has access to

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:16.160
totems some totems have built-in

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.559
abilities like Shockwave totem which can

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.120
be placed to stun nearby enemies and

00:17:17.559 --> 00:17:20.880
Trigger aftershocks like those from the

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:22.480
earthquake but you can also get

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:24.520
ancestral Warrior totems which allow you

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:26.679
to use any slam skill in your

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.839
repertoire this is a meta skill which

00:17:26.679 --> 00:17:30.120
means that it's a skill you can put

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:32.120
other skills into I can take a slam like

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:34.200
Su and socket it into my ancestral

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.559
Warrior totem now when I summon him

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.120
he'll sit there and slam the monsters

00:17:35.559 --> 00:17:39.600
from a distance

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:41.280
badass badass there are 20 active skills

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.960
for maces so there's a lot more to try

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.480
out but by end game you're going to be

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.160
dropping hammers from the sky leaping

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:49.080
fearlessly into combat and separating

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.080
the very Earth you stand

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:55.640
on time for some ranged attacks the

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:57.280
ranger is primarily about the bow but we

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:59.679
wanted to make sure that she feels agile

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:01.720
as well and PE we two you can shoot

00:17:59.679 --> 00:18:03.159
while moving combined with all the

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.919
skills the ranger has that allow you to

00:18:03.159 --> 00:18:07.280
jump around you'll have a lot of

00:18:04.919 --> 00:18:09.760
mobility in

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:12.039
combat bow skills have a variety of

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:14.480
lightning poison ice and physical

00:18:12.039 --> 00:18:16.559
attacks lightning attacks bounce around

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.720
between targets you can also stick

00:18:16.559 --> 00:18:19.640
lightning arrows in the ground which

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:23.120
explode when hit by the bouncers or

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.120
electrocute enemies to take them out of

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:27.480
combat ice attacks all to slow and

00:18:26.039 --> 00:18:29.320
freeze enemies to keep them away from

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:31.000
you

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:32.919
using poison not only can you slowly

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.240
damage your enemies from afar but also

00:18:32.919 --> 00:18:39.039
grow some interesting

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:41.000
plants with 21 bow skills and all the

00:18:39.039 --> 00:18:42.720
mobility and combo tools the ranger has

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.840
you can take advantage of every

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:46.520
situation by end game you'll be creating

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:48.200
hundreds of arrows be they falling from

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:50.440
the sky bouncing around between enemies

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.520
or spraying out of

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:54.080
tornadoes you might have noticed in the

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:56.799
bottom left of the screen that the flask

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:59.280
slots look a little different in Pee 2

00:18:56.799 --> 00:19:02.240
you have one dedicated life flask slot

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:04.120
and one Mana flask slot flasks gain

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.960
charges as you kill enemies and

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:08.360
typically allow you to heal six or seven

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:10.559
times if they're fa but that's not the

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:12.559
only thing you can use charges for

00:19:10.559 --> 00:19:14.200
charms are a new item type that will

00:19:12.559 --> 00:19:16.840
automatically defend you from various

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:19.080
debuffs or damage types having trouble

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:21.280
with getting Frozen equip a thoring

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:23.320
charm when it's fully charged it will

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:26.039
make you immune to freeze from 3 seconds

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:27.440
if you get Frozen to recharge them just

00:19:26.039 --> 00:19:29.440
kill more

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:32.679
monsters you can you can gain more slots

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.679
for charms by upgrading your

00:19:33.159 --> 00:19:37.320
belt the mercenary wields a crossbow

00:19:35.799 --> 00:19:39.640
that can be loaded with different ammo

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:42.360
types offering versatility power and

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:44.919
Mobility all classes and path of XL2 can

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:47.200
be controlled with WD which makes this

00:19:44.919 --> 00:19:48.720
class play exactly like a shooter for

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:51.919
the crossbow you will find skills that

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:55.159
work like shotguns sniper rifles assault

00:19:51.919 --> 00:19:56.679
rifles and even grenade launchers but

00:19:55.159 --> 00:19:59.240
not only that there are a wide variety

00:19:56.679 --> 00:20:01.080
of more interesting Elemental ammos too

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.360
it's very fast to switch between ammo

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.400
types so long as you already have them

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:08.200
loaded which makes the mercenary able to

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:10.760
combo abilities together for devastating

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:12.840
effect use glacial bolt to create walls

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:14.679
of ice to separate enemies then switch

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:19.240
to fragmentation rounds to explode the

00:20:14.679 --> 00:20:20.840
ice deive AE damage if I come across I

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.440
could use armor piercing rounds to break

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.720
their armor and then High Velocity

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:26.840
rounds to take them down or perap I can

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:28.360
fire a gasen to poison enemies before

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:31.240
detonating the cloud with an explosive

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.240
shot for massive

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:35.200
damage if you want to call in some

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:37.720
suppressing fire you can summon

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:39.080
artillery bists these have a minimum

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:42.600
range so you'll want to prepare your

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.600
position carefully before moving

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.960
in there are 22 active skills for

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:49.520
crossbows by end game you'll be calling

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:51.120
destruction down from the sky as you

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:53.200
litter the battlefield With Grenades and

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:55.240
peff your enemies with your Automatic

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:57.000
Shotgun If you're looking to take a back

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:59.120
seat and let your minions do the work

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.039
then the wit should be your choice she

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:03.000
can call forth hordes of Undead monsters

00:21:01.039 --> 00:21:05.559
to fight for her while casting powerful

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.760
chaos spells that debilitate her

00:21:05.559 --> 00:21:09.720
enemies Ault skills are some of the most

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:12.120
varied in the game with skeletons

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:14.880
noxious spells specialty minions curses

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:16.279
and sacrificial magic before we talk

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:18.440
about minions we'll have to talk about a

00:21:16.279 --> 00:21:20.960
new resource in path of XL 2 called

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:22.559
spirit this is a spirit gem which allows

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:24.960
you to pick from a range of persistent

00:21:22.559 --> 00:21:26.400
skills all classes have a variety of

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.720
these skills which can add some very

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.080
interesting effects like Arctic armor

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.360
which does cold damage to enemies that

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:34.559
hit you or raging Spirits which summon

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:37.039
fiery skulls each time you cast a fire

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:38.640
spell for the witch though we'll want to

00:21:37.039 --> 00:21:40.919
be using our spirit to create permanent

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:42.679
minions these minions will be revived

00:21:40.919 --> 00:21:44.000
automatically when they die so you don't

00:21:42.679 --> 00:21:46.159
have to worry about resummoning them all

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.159
the

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:50.679
time here I'm using the skill screen to

00:21:49.159 --> 00:21:53.120
allocate which minions I would like in

00:21:50.679 --> 00:21:55.880
my horde you can see the spirit cost of

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:57.840
each one skeletal Warriors are cheap but

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:59.440
weak useful for tanking damage and

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:01.400
distracting enemies

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.799
but I want more Heavy Hitters in my Army

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:04.960
so I'm going to unsummon some Warriors

00:22:02.799 --> 00:22:07.120
and a Shad at skeletal

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:08.960
arsonists permanent minions come with

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:10.960
special active abilities called command

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:12.640
skills you can order these guys to

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:15.080
detonate your own minions for even more

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:17.480
damage and a of effect if you want a

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:19.440
bigger Army you'll need a scepter this

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:21.720
new weapon type is imbued with even more

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:23.640
Spirit allowing you to summon even more

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:25.640
friends and if you want an even bigger

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:28.640
Army than that you can take advantage of

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:30.440
corpses to summon true hordes of minions

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:32.760
but what can a witch do while her Army

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:34.240
is at work well she has a range of chaos

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:36.880
spells to spread disease amongst your

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:38.679
enemies or bone skills to impale them or

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:42.320
you know you could curse them to make we

00:22:38.679 --> 00:22:44.400
your abilities is awesome there are 25

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.880
active occult skills by the end game

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:49.559
you'll be the leader of a fearsome Army

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:49.559
of the Dead consuming everything in its

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:54.240
path the Sorceress bends the elements to

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:56.679
her will using them to unleash

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:59.039
Devastation on her foes this classic

00:22:56.679 --> 00:23:00.799
spellcaster weaves a flurry of Al

00:22:59.039 --> 00:23:03.000
look how cool this looks you're not

00:23:00.799 --> 00:23:05.480
standing still everything you might

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.880
expect and

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:09.360
more storms you get moving around and

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:10.919
blowing each spell is unique and has

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:12.720
many different ways to build and combo

00:23:10.919 --> 00:23:15.559
with others even between different

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:17.240
elements for example flame wall conjures

00:23:15.559 --> 00:23:19.039
a burning line that not only damages

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:21.279
enemies but also empowers all

00:23:19.039 --> 00:23:22.960
projectiles that pass through it if you

00:23:21.279 --> 00:23:25.120
place a wall and fire lightning Sparks

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:27.120
through it they'll gain extra fire

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:28.799
damage it's a good idea to take

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:31.000
advantage of the ability to autom ically

00:23:28.799 --> 00:23:32.720
swap weapons when you use certain skills

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.760
having a special staff with bonuses to

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:36.600
fire skills and another with bonuses to

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:39.159
lightning skills can really power up a

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:41.679
combo like this the Sorceress can also

00:23:39.159 --> 00:23:43.640
take advantage of powerful trigger gems

00:23:41.679 --> 00:23:46.640
for example you could grab the Caston

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:48.520
ignite Gem and use it with Firestorm as

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:51.039
you ignite enemies a counter will go up

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:52.840
in the top left corner when it's full a

00:23:51.039 --> 00:23:54.080
firestorm will automatically be cast to

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:56.880
the enemy that was

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:58.840
ignited there are 25 active Elemental

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:01.640
skills by end game you'll be be firing

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:03.159
off projectiles left and right you down

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.559
your they're fine dude [ __ ] the other

00:24:03.159 --> 00:24:05.720
class I might be doing this those are

00:24:04.559 --> 00:24:07.640
the characters that will be available at

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:09.400
the start of Early Access but we will be

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:11.760
adding six more character classes with

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:13.320
just as many skills and options as these

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:15.520
there's a lot more to

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:17.600
come there's one more important thing to

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:19.640
mention about skills even though we talk

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:21.720
about them as belong to each class in

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:24.039
reality there are no restrictions you

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:25.440
can use all these skills on any class so

00:24:24.039 --> 00:24:28.159
long as you have the

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:29.799
attributes for example a poison Ranger

00:24:28.159 --> 00:24:32.760
might want to try out using occult

00:24:29.799 --> 00:24:34.120
curses to increase her poison damage mon

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:36.159
might want to trigger Elemental ice

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:38.520
walls to use with his glacial Cascade

00:24:36.159 --> 00:24:40.520
combo the possibilities for cross-class

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:41.760
combos are practically unlimited we're

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:44.440
looking forward to what kind of things

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:46.600
you guys might find now path of Exel is

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:48.200
a game known for build customization and

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:49.760
we haven't even scratched the surface of

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:53.960
what is possible

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:53.960
yet so let's talk about support

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:58.399
gems path of XL2 has a system of support

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.039
gems that can be combined with your

00:24:58.399 --> 00:25:02.679
active skills to dramatically change the

00:25:00.039 --> 00:25:04.760
way they work if you find a support gem

00:25:02.679 --> 00:25:07.120
then right clicking it will open up this

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:08.600
screen here you will find a variety of

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:11.120
recommended support gems for each of

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:12.840
your skills that you can pick between

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.640
for example this is a multiple

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:17.480
projectile support gem can be used to

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:19.000
add multiple projectiles to any skill

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.080
normally when you fire a grenade it'll

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.640
look like

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:25.039
this but if we add multiple projectiles

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:26.919
then you get three of them once you have

00:25:25.039 --> 00:25:28.039
the Gen you can also freely move it

00:25:26.919 --> 00:25:29.000
between any of the skills in your

00:25:28.039 --> 00:25:30.520
character

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.559
if you want to have a multi-shot sniper

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:34.919
rifle instead then simply move the gem

00:25:32.559 --> 00:25:36.559
over to your high velocity round skill

00:25:34.919 --> 00:25:38.039
generally speaking if it sounds like a

00:25:36.559 --> 00:25:41.279
support gem should work with a skill

00:25:38.039 --> 00:25:43.279
then it will work so it's a good idea to

00:25:41.279 --> 00:25:44.440
experiment note that you can only have

00:25:43.279 --> 00:25:45.880
one of each support gem on your

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.360
character so you'll want to think

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.919
carefully about which supports can be

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:52.120
used best with each skill for maximum

00:25:49.919 --> 00:25:53.600
damage now if you want to stick to the

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:55.399
recommendations you should have a

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:57.440
perfectly good time but if you want to

00:25:55.399 --> 00:25:59.080
experiment a bit more then uncheck that

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:00.480
recommended button and you can see the

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:02.600
full list of supports that will work

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:04.559
with your skill there are hundreds of

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.640
support gems to choose from and even we

00:26:04.559 --> 00:26:07.840
don't know the results of all the

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:09.360
possible ways these can interact each

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:11.320
skill can have up to five supports

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.360
socketed into it and if you're clever

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.919
you can come up with some pretty

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:16.880
interesting ideas now all of this is

00:26:14.919 --> 00:26:19.120
just scratching the surface you can make

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:21.880
Frost vortexes break people's armor make

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:24.080
minions explode make skills

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:26.640
repeat make enemies set each other on

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:28.960
fire C enemies or pin them to the

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:30.799
ground supports let you drastically

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.559
change the behavior of your skills and

00:26:30.799 --> 00:26:35.320
create your own unique build or at least

00:26:32.559 --> 00:26:36.679
follow someone's OP build guide So

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:39.240
speaking of builds let's talk about one

00:26:36.679 --> 00:26:43.000
of the most iconic Path of Exile systems

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:45.720
the passive skill tree yes it's huge

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.320
there are over, 1500 nodes on there now

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:49.840
a lot of people open the tree and can

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:51.679
get a little intimidated at first follow

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:55.320
try not to be scared there are lots of

00:26:51.679 --> 00:26:57.000
options but at its follow build please

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:59.039
each level you get one point to put into

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.520
the tree each class starts at a

00:26:59.039 --> 00:27:03.200
different location but they all share

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:04.880
the same tree around your section of the

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:07.000
tree you'll find relevant bonuses for

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:08.200
your character you should be safe in the

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.120
knowledge that there aren't many wrong

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.679
choices here almost all the starting

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:13.840
nodes will be useful for your character

00:27:11.679 --> 00:27:15.600
in some way but if you do happen to make

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:17.120
a choice you regret you'll be able to

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:19.960
Respec any nodes you've taken by

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.960
spending a little bit of

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:27.120
gold now the tree is generally divided

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:29.200
up into clusters which have similar

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.919
themes and each cluster you will find

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:33.039
small nodes that give simple bonuses

00:27:30.919 --> 00:27:34.200
like increased damage but the real power

00:27:33.039 --> 00:27:36.480
comes from

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:38.360
notables notables normally have much

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.960
more interesting bonuses and they tend

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:42.399
to care a lot more about how your build

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:44.320
works and what skills you're using for

00:27:42.399 --> 00:27:46.760
example in the mercenary area of the

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:48.880
tree this one gives a 25% chance for

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:51.240
crossbow skills to not consume a

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:54.039
bolt and here's one that gives grenades

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:56.200
a chance to blow up a second

00:27:54.039 --> 00:27:58.480
time this one gives a chance of

00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:00.000
projectiles to rebound off Terrain as

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:02.559
well as giving you some Pierce chance to

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.440
make that more likely note that even

00:28:02.559 --> 00:28:05.880
though this is in the mercenary section

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:08.000
this would work with projectiles from

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:09.960
all classes so there are often reasons

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.240
to go to different areas of the

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:13.640
tree in order to get between these

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:16.480
clusters you will generally have to

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:18.159
allocate nodes in the attribute highways

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:20.120
attribute nodes allow you to pick which

00:28:18.159 --> 00:28:21.640
attribute you would like to use so it's

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:23.840
very easy to get points for any

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:25.399
attribute that your gear might need you

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:27.159
can change which attribute these nodes

00:28:25.399 --> 00:28:28.880
give you for half price at the Respec

00:28:27.159 --> 00:28:30.600
vendor

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:32.360
in addition to notables you will also

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:34.960
find even larger passives called

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:36.960
keystones keystones have both an upside

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:38.679
and a downside and often require

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:41.480
changing your entire build to design

00:28:38.679 --> 00:28:43.640
around them a great example is Giants

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:45.799
blood which allows you to wield two hand

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:48.240
weapons and a single hand but doubles

00:28:45.799 --> 00:28:50.039
the attribute requirements of them you

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:52.880
can use a twohand mace with a shield or

00:28:50.039 --> 00:28:52.880
even dual wield

00:28:52.919 --> 00:28:58.200
them bad ass they has have about Mind

00:28:56.399 --> 00:29:00.039
Over mattera which makes all damage go

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:02.279
to your Mana pool first before your life

00:29:00.039 --> 00:29:04.679
pool but you lose 50% of your Mana

00:29:02.279 --> 00:29:06.240
region skills like these can be tough to

00:29:04.679 --> 00:29:08.840
build around but if you're up for the

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:11.120
challenge they can be very

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:12.919
rewarding as we showed you earlier on

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:14.440
the Sorceress you can swap between

00:29:12.919 --> 00:29:16.919
weapon sets on the fly as you use

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:19.200
certain skills one of the new features

00:29:16.919 --> 00:29:20.720
in path of XL 2's passive tree is that

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:22.720
you can choose to have your passive tree

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:24.720
change as you switch between weapon sets

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:26.799
to take advantage of specific bonuses on

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:30.039
the tree oh my God for the Sorceress you

00:29:26.799 --> 00:29:30.039
might to change between

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:34.039
specialization oh my God or you could

00:29:32.399 --> 00:29:35.720
switch between one hand and a two hand

00:29:34.039 --> 00:29:37.360
setup in order to be able to block boss

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:39.760
attacks while following up with heavy

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:41.120
hits from your bigger mace or perhaps

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:43.039
you could have a full curse setup on

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:44.799
your witch to debuff enemies before

00:29:43.039 --> 00:29:47.240
switching to a chaos DJ build for

00:29:44.799 --> 00:29:47.240
maximum

00:29:47.679 --> 00:29:51.799
damage if you want to stick with just

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:53.799
one weapon set you can just use these

00:29:51.799 --> 00:29:55.799
specialization points as bonus points to

00:29:53.799 --> 00:29:56.880
invest however you like but creative

00:29:55.799 --> 00:29:59.720
players will find plenty of

00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:01.720
opportunities with this system

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:03.279
you can get weapon specialization points

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:06.200
throughout the campaign from optional

00:30:03.279 --> 00:30:07.919
bosses and Quests for example if I

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:10.679
manage to defeat the crow Bell I'll get

00:30:07.919 --> 00:30:12.640
a weapon specialization book there are

00:30:10.679 --> 00:30:15.120
lots of other permanent boosts available

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:16.880
from the campaign 2 on the map you can

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:19.039
see icons that indicate the many

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:20.880
optional encounters you can find some of

00:30:19.039 --> 00:30:22.919
them have permanent character boosts and

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:24.679
others have powerful items if you're

00:30:22.919 --> 00:30:26.320
having trouble getting past a boss it

00:30:24.679 --> 00:30:28.760
might be a good idea to explore and see

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:30.519
what you can find First for example if

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:32.360
you defeat black jaw The Remnant you'll

00:30:30.519 --> 00:30:34.440
gain a permanent increase to fire

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:36.919
resistance one of the most important

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:39.360
finds are Spirit bonuses you can find

00:30:36.919 --> 00:30:41.200
the first one here in the canopy par a

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:42.880
little bit defeat the boss in this area

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:45.039
to acquire a permanent addition of

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:47.360
spirit the permanent Buffs you gain from

00:30:45.039 --> 00:30:49.039
Spirit are very powerful and every class

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:50.919
will find a use for them so make sure

00:30:49.039 --> 00:30:53.519
you hunt down these upgrades there's one

00:30:50.919 --> 00:30:54.960
in each act now we haven't even talked

00:30:53.519 --> 00:30:57.080
about the most important element of

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:58.840
character progression items that's why

00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:00.440
we're all here right

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:03.000
items in Path of Exile can be broken

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:05.120
down into four Rarity groups normal

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000
magic rare and

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:08.120
unique one of the things you're going to

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.200
want to do as you play through the

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:12.639
campaign is upgrade the items you find

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:14.480
and you can do that with currency items

00:31:12.639 --> 00:31:16.440
an orb of transmutation will allow you

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:18.919
to upgrade a normal item to a magic item

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:21.240
with one mod you can then apply an orb

00:31:18.919 --> 00:31:23.480
of augmentation to add a second mod then

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:26.000
use a Regal orb to add a third mod and

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:28.000
upgrade it to a rare finally you can use

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.360
some exalted orbs to add more mods to to

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.360
your rare to a total of six

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:34.840
mods one of the things we think is

00:31:33.559 --> 00:31:37.480
really important is to make these

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:39.240
options available to use as you play all

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:41.200
the items that add mods are much more

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:42.600
common than they were in part of XL one

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:45.080
so that you can use them throughout your

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:46.200
campaign playthrough cool we want you to

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:47.600
find things on the ground that can be

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:49.639
crafted into upgrades much more

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:51.240
frequently love that I love that as well

00:31:49.639 --> 00:31:53.120
as making the drop rates on these items

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:55.000
much more common you can also get them

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:57.159
by disenchanting unwanted gear at the

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.960
magic item vendor if you disenchant

00:31:57.159 --> 00:32:02.399
magic items you can build up to an or of

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:04.279
trans gearing up my character as I play

00:32:02.399 --> 00:32:07.880
not just like getting a gear set

00:32:04.279 --> 00:32:09.159
blasting the campaign it is going and

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:12.080
shopping

00:32:09.159 --> 00:32:14.360
it slite runes placed in them that add

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:15.960
more mods to the item if I insert this

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:18.720
glacial Rune into my helmet that will

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:20.039
give extra cold resistance this is a

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.919
great way to solve problems that you

00:32:20.039 --> 00:32:24.159
have with your build like resistances or

00:32:21.919 --> 00:32:25.679
damage if you find socketed items that

00:32:24.159 --> 00:32:27.240
you don't have a use for you can take

00:32:25.679 --> 00:32:29.760
them to the Salvage bench in town to

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.919
work towards artifices or this will

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.799
allow you to add sockets to your

00:32:30.919 --> 00:32:35.720
existing items body armors and twoand

00:32:33.799 --> 00:32:37.039
weapons can have up to two sockets while

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.639
the rest of your armor and oneand

00:32:37.039 --> 00:32:39.960
weapons can only have one socket the

00:32:38.639 --> 00:32:42.039
simplification is nice you can also

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:44.760
Salvage items with quality to create it

00:32:42.039 --> 00:32:46.159
like scraps Stones these will allow you

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:48.960
to increase the quality of your items

00:32:46.159 --> 00:32:51.279
for an up to 20% boost yeah this game's

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:52.760
free if you don't want to disenchant or

00:32:51.279 --> 00:32:55.279
Salvage your items you can always sell

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:57.039
them for gold gold can be used to buy

00:32:55.279 --> 00:32:58.240
items from vendors and we've tried to do

00:32:57.039 --> 00:33:00.519
a lot to make sure that the the items

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:01.960
they have for sale are actually useful

00:33:00.519 --> 00:33:04.919
every time you level up they get more

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:07.320
stock so make sure to check back often

00:33:04.919 --> 00:33:08.840
other vendors offer a gamble pay a flat

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:11.240
amount of gold and you'll get a random

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:13.000
item of a specific type this could be a

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:15.799
great way to improve your gear if you're

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.760
lucky gold is also used to Respec your

00:33:15.799 --> 00:33:19.399
passive skills take advantage of the

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:22.279
system to experiment with your tree and

00:33:19.399 --> 00:33:23.559
rework it as required this is the other

00:33:22.279 --> 00:33:25.840
thing you might want to use gold for is

00:33:23.559 --> 00:33:27.279
the currency exchange this allows you to

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:29.720
exchange currency items with other

00:33:27.279 --> 00:33:32.679
players open market in exchange for a

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:35.159
small gold fee now all items in Path of

00:33:32.679 --> 00:33:38.639
Exile are freely tradable we never bind

00:33:35.159 --> 00:33:38.639
anything to your character except

00:33:40.399 --> 00:33:44.919
gold now most gear and path of exalto is

00:33:43.159 --> 00:33:47.840
randomly generated but there's another

00:33:44.919 --> 00:33:50.159
type that isn't uniques they are

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:51.760
especially rare each with a handcrafted

00:33:50.159 --> 00:33:54.000
set of unusual mods which can

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:55.840
dramatically change a character's build

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.799
they're not just better rare items they

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:59.480
can do much stranger things that can fun

00:33:57.799 --> 00:34:01.799
mentally change your

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:03.600
character corpse Wade will make any

00:34:01.799 --> 00:34:07.080
corpses you run through explode into

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:08.679
clouds of poison what the Sands of silk

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:10.960
is a body armor that changes your Dodge

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:13.599
roll into a blink morphing you into sand

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:14.839
as you teleport past your foes and of

00:34:13.599 --> 00:34:17.040
course some uniques are just pure hits

00:34:14.839 --> 00:34:18.919
of dopamine like quill rain which just

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:21.000
turns your bow attacks into full auto by

00:34:18.919 --> 00:34:23.159
doubling your attack

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.200
speed each unique is something that you

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:26.800
can build your character around we try

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:29.119
to make sure that most unique items have

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:31.320
a potential use in game even if you find

00:34:29.119 --> 00:34:32.879
them early on and as you can see every

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:35.040
single unique item comes with custom art

00:34:32.879 --> 00:34:35.040
to

00:34:35.359 --> 00:34:38.679
match the last character progression

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:40.040
system that you can do during the

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:42.280
campaign is

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:44.560
Ascension starting an act two you will

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.879
come across Ascension trials tests that

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:47.960
you must complete to unlock your

00:34:45.879 --> 00:34:49.839
Ascension class we'll explain these

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:51.399
trials soon but first let's take a look

00:34:49.839 --> 00:34:53.800
at what ascending can do for your

00:34:51.399 --> 00:34:55.599
character each class has access to three

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:57.280
ascendency classes but at the start of

00:34:55.599 --> 00:34:58.440
Early Access only two per class will be

00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:00.240
available

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:02.320
okay ascendency classes are unique to

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.800
each character class so Choose Wisely

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:05.760
they can drastically affect how you

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:07.920
build your

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:10.280
character as a sorceress you could

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:12.920
become a storm Weaver a master of the

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:14.599
elements Tempest caller causes Elemental

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:16.599
storms to be summoned each time you do a

00:35:14.599 --> 00:35:19.200
critical hit with a

00:35:16.599 --> 00:35:21.480
spell with strike twice you can stack

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:22.960
two copies of shock for more damage and

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:25.160
going deeper into the tree you can make

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:28.079
all your damage types Supply shock make

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:29.440
a shock build from any skill

00:35:28.079 --> 00:35:32.920
alternatively you could become a

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:34.560
chronomancer and command time itself she

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:37.000
literally has the ability to stop time

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:38.520

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:27.319
challenges would you like to face and

00:43:24.599 --> 00:43:29.359
which rewards do you want to claim some

00:43:27.319 --> 00:43:30.880
rooms are more dangerous afflicting you

00:43:29.359 --> 00:43:34.040
with debuffs that will persist for the

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:36.119
entire trial for example entering this

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:37.599
room will afflict you with spiked shell

00:43:36.119 --> 00:43:40.640
that will cause all monsters in the rest

00:43:37.599 --> 00:43:42.319
of the trial to have 50% increased life

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:44.040
you will want to take care if you choose

00:43:42.319 --> 00:43:46.520
such a

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:49.760
path different challenges and rewards

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:51.359
Journey Through the trial deadly traps

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:54.000
waves of

00:43:51.359 --> 00:43:55.040
monsters and strange artifacts will test

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.400
your

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:59.440
honor as you progress you'll be able to

00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:01.640
gain Boon from the Gin which will help

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:03.960
you on your journey for example the

00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:06.559
Sea's cloak will revive you once if you

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:09.160
die giving you a second shot at a

00:44:06.559 --> 00:44:11.640
run one of the rewards you may find is

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:13.920
Sacred Water an extremely valuable and

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:16.319
treasured resource to the Jin and the

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:18.680
Marth trading it with the Jin will allow

00:44:16.319 --> 00:44:21.280
you to receive many benefits you can

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:22.880
recover honor gain additional Bon or

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:24.839
remove

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:26.440
afflictions at the end of the floor

00:44:24.839 --> 00:44:29.079
you'll find a powerful boss which will

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:31.720
truly test your limitations in order to

00:44:29.079 --> 00:44:35.359
ascend you will need to defeat

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:38.880
him a rattle cage you think Max is going

00:44:35.359 --> 00:44:40.880
to play this game he never plays poe1

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:42.079
cuz it's too complicated but this having

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:44.480
defeated the boss you've earned the

00:44:42.079 --> 00:44:46.880
right to but first the

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:48.400
loot the keys you have found may be used

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:50.920
to open the various Treasures in the

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:52.960
vault at the end of the floor we only

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:55.119
have a single bronze key so we'll just

00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:56.240
have to open one of these small chests

00:44:55.119 --> 00:44:58.640
if you want to open the better ones

00:44:56.240 --> 00:45:01.160
you'll need silver or or gold keys let's

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:02.640
use the alter of ascendency your first

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:04.520
Ascension will allow you to pick your

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:05.160
class and Grant you two points to use in

00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:07.520
the

00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:08.880
tree now there are more flaws and many

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:10.800
more rewards that can be found within

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:12.800
the trial of the seus but we'll save

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:14.040
that for the section on the end game for

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:16.960
now let's talk about the second

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:18.920
ascendency trial the trial of Chaos in

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:21.119
path of XL 2 you can choose whichever

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:23.000
trial you like to earn your Ascension

00:45:21.119 --> 00:45:25.480
each culture on Ray clast had their own

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.559
methods to ascend if the trial of the

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:28.880
seers is not your kind of place style or

00:45:27.559 --> 00:45:30.839
you're finding it too difficult you

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:32.680
could try another you can gain all your

00:45:30.839 --> 00:45:35.240
Ascension points from just one or mix

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:36.720
and match them it's up to you for Early

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:38.359
Access we will have two trials as

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:39.520
options with a third trial coming later

00:45:38.359 --> 00:45:42.119
for the full

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:44.760
release while exploring the vile jungle

00:45:42.119 --> 00:45:46.559
you'll discover the Temple of chaos

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:48.960
before the vile embraced the science of

00:45:46.559 --> 00:45:51.599
corruption their civilization worshiped

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:54.319
chaos this ancient trial was once used

00:45:51.599 --> 00:45:55.599
by the V to test their High priests a

00:45:54.319 --> 00:45:57.440
high priest of the vile must show

00:45:55.599 --> 00:45:59.839
willingness to risk everything to gain

00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:01.880
power entry to the trial requires a

00:45:59.839 --> 00:46:04.240
token from a strange entity known only

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:07.280
as The Trial Master for those in which

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:09.240
he sees potential he shall inscribe an

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:11.400
ultimatum many have attempted these

00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:13.520
trials in search of greatness most have

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:16.119
perished will you be able to defy the

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:18.160
odds before you begin each chamber The

00:46:16.119 --> 00:46:20.319
Trial Master will offer you a reward and

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:21.880
a choice choose one of three

00:46:20.319 --> 00:46:24.359
tribulations to affect you through the

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:26.599
rest of the trial these modifiers might

00:46:24.359 --> 00:46:28.359
beef up the monsters curse the player or

00:46:26.599 --> 00:46:31.200
ADD environmental hazards like turrets

00:46:28.359 --> 00:46:33.960
or trap runes in this case we will be

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:33.960
picking shocking

00:46:35.839 --> 00:46:39.920
turrets as you enter the room The Trial

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:42.160
Master will fill it with hazards to test

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:43.599
your commitment in this case You Must

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:45.040
Destroy All The Monsters That fill the

00:46:43.599 --> 00:46:46.640
room while dealing with the lightning

00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:49.440
projectiles from the shocking

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:52.760
turrets what is this for I missed what

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:52.760
this was for

00:47:00.599 --> 00:47:06.559
ascending no ascending is

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:07.960
already oh it's a different way to

00:47:06.559 --> 00:47:10.440
ascend

00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:13.680
oh cuz like they already explained how

00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:13.680
you ascend right so I'm

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:18.079
confused after each room you will need

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.000
to make a choice take the rewards you

00:47:18.079 --> 00:47:22.000
have earned so far or go double or

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000
nothing increase your rewards but take

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.640
on more

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.640
risk each tribulation you add is minor

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:30.000
on its own but they quickly stack on top

00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:31.640
of each other and can become

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.040
overwhelming why would they give you

00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:34.040
multiple ways to ascend what is the

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:36.040
point of that there are many types of

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:38.440
Chambers in the trial each will test

00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:40.280
your resolve in different ways this one

00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:41.480
simply requires for a certain amount of

00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:42.480
time maybe you get more points by doing

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:44.240
this I don't [ __ ] know another

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:45.680
requires you to escort the stone Idol

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:48.520
through the level as elevators full of

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:49.720
monsters descend to attack you should

00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:51.680
you be able to get through the first

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:54.480
three chambers you will face your first

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:55.920
boss the order of the bosses is random

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:57.400
and combined with the tribulations you

00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:58.640
have selected the fight will never feel

00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:59.760
the same they said in case one is too

00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:01.240
difficult for you or you don't like one

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:03.319
same points after defeating the boss you

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:06.000
may claim your

00:48:03.319 --> 00:48:08.520
options you also gain the right to

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.119
ascend that's crazy if you already did

00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:13.559
the trial of the Seas then you can claim

00:48:10.119 --> 00:48:15.280
two more points youry class now it's

00:48:13.559 --> 00:48:18.040
possible to go much deeper there are

00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:19.520
more bosses and risks to take but we'll

00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:21.720
talk more about that when we get to end

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:24.960
game that's insane how about we talk

00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:26.119
about that now okay so far we've only

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:28.000
been showing you footage from the

00:48:26.119 --> 00:48:29.520
campaign but some people would argue

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.880
that the end game is where the game

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:33.559
truly begins something that happens

00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:35.280
almost every time a new action RPG

00:48:33.559 --> 00:48:37.760
launches is people saying there isn't

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:39.839
enough in-game content well we want to

00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:41.720
make sure that in pee2 people don't feel

00:48:39.839 --> 00:48:43.480
that way and we actually only changed

00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:46.160
our development priority for this

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:48.000
recently the first three acts of pee2

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:50.119
already take around 25 hours to complete

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:52.480
if you're a new player this is already a

00:48:50.119 --> 00:48:54.040
pretty significant campaign on the other

00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:56.359
hand people spend hundreds of hours in

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:57.640
endgame each league we realized that

00:48:56.359 --> 00:49:00.079
finishing the rest of the campaign for

00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:01.720
Early Access was actually a bad idea

00:49:00.079 --> 00:49:03.640
instead of having a four to six in Early

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:06.480
Access we could concentrate on in-game

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:08.559
and make that great for new players a

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:10.559
25-hour campaign is already a huge game

00:49:08.559 --> 00:49:12.319
with lots of content but for existing

00:49:10.559 --> 00:49:14.079
action RPG players what you mostly care

00:49:12.319 --> 00:49:16.160
about is all the endgame challenges to

00:49:14.079 --> 00:49:17.760
overcome so several months ago we

00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:20.760
switched the entire development team's

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:22.160
Focus over to making ingame content at

00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:25.000
the start of Early Access there will be

00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:26.440
50 bosses and around 400 monster types

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.880
but the great thing is that the rest of

00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:30.359
the game is like 80% there we'll be

00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:31.880
adding content to roughly double the

00:49:30.359 --> 00:49:34.359
size of the game during early access and

00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:35.880
into release now in order to make the

00:49:34.359 --> 00:49:37.359
end game happen at the same character

00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:39.079
level as what it would be after we added

00:49:37.359 --> 00:49:41.119
the rest of the acts we've added a

00:49:39.079 --> 00:49:42.359
second difficulty level called cruel

00:49:41.119 --> 00:49:44.480
where you repeat the campaign with all

00:49:42.359 --> 00:49:46.760
the monsters and bosses leveled up and

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:49.480
of course new rewards you can kind of

00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:50.720
think of it as like a new game plus it's

00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:52.000
also a lot faster to get through the

00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:54.000
content the second time as your clear

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:55.799
speed increases that will take you to

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.160
around level 65 where the end game

00:49:55.799 --> 00:49:58.680
begins

00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:00.880
once we add the remaining three acts

00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:02.040
we'll be removing cruel difficulty so

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:04.599
you'll progress straight from the end of

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:06.599
act this weird this is weird but what is

00:50:04.599 --> 00:50:09.359
the endgame to explain that I'll hand

00:50:06.599 --> 00:50:11.400
over to Mark tell you all about it I

00:50:09.359 --> 00:50:13.640
don't know about that but hi that's fine

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:17.079
I'm Mark Roberts game director on path

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:19.559
of xile 2 well one thing that Path of

00:50:17.079 --> 00:50:21.799
Exile is known for is having a lot of

00:50:19.559 --> 00:50:24.359
distinct endgame content to choose

00:50:21.799 --> 00:50:27.559
between each endgame mechanic needs to

00:50:24.359 --> 00:50:30.520
have its own progression system

00:50:27.559 --> 00:50:32.880
bosses rewards and player power that can

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:35.040
only be gained from that content we are

00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:37.040
going to be adding a lot more over time

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:38.960
but for Path of Exile 2 we decided to

00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:42.599
start with seven distinct systems you

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:44.319
can progress through this is the Atlas

00:50:42.599 --> 00:50:47.000
and it serves as the core of the end

00:50:44.319 --> 00:50:49.720
game for Path of Exile 2 it's infinite

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.400
and expands in all directions now we are

00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:53.119
not going to spoil the plot too much

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:55.079
here but corruption from the Beast has

00:50:53.119 --> 00:50:57.359
blighted the land and your objective is

00:50:55.079 --> 00:50:59.440
to help fight it in at the center of the

00:50:57.359 --> 00:51:01.520
atlas you will find the ziggurat a

00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:04.040
temple in which the V research the

00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:06.559
fundamentals of space and time here we

00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:08.920
can open portals to nearby locations and

00:51:06.559 --> 00:51:11.400
begin cleansing corruption

00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:14.359
Andes in order to power the Portal

00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:15.920
Device we will need waist Stones each

00:51:14.359 --> 00:51:17.559
waist Stone has a tear which will

00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:20.680
determine the level of the monsters that

00:51:17.559 --> 00:51:22.480
you will face to go to an area simply

00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:24.400
click one that is adjacent to an area

00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:27.200
that you have already completed insert

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:29.200
the wa Stone and click Traverse portals

00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:31.880
will open allowing you and your party to

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:33.760
travel to the area you have selected all

00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:35.640
the areas in the endgame feel distinct

00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:37.440
from the locations in the campaign and

00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:39.559
we have dialed the randomization up to

00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:41.400
11 the monster packs you will face in

00:51:39.559 --> 00:51:43.119
each map are totally random and the

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:45.400
combination of them can lead to some

00:51:43.119 --> 00:51:47.680
very interesting combat situations there

00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:49.880
are over 400 monster types in Early

00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:52.160
Access and they have a lot of varied and

00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:54.079
interesting abilities depending on which

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:56.680
combinations you face you might find

00:51:54.079 --> 00:51:58.359
some serious challenges in order to to

00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:00.040
cleanse the corruption from the area you

00:51:58.359 --> 00:52:02.480
will need to defeat all the powerful

00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:04.240
rare and unique enemies in it once you

00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:05.799
have done that the area will be marked

00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:07.720
as completed and you will be able to

00:52:05.799 --> 00:52:10.559
travel past it to progress deeper into

00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:12.240
the world if you die then the map can no

00:52:10.559 --> 00:52:14.119
longer be run and you will have to find

00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:16.599
another way around to get to the areas

00:52:14.119 --> 00:52:18.240
behind it there are also all kinds of

00:52:16.599 --> 00:52:20.799
other Random Encounters you might run

00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:23.000
into as you play maps one such encounter

00:52:20.799 --> 00:52:24.799
are precursor artifacts these are

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.680
ancient corrupting monuments that

00:52:24.799 --> 00:52:28.200
irradiate the monsters around them the

00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:30.240
monsters that feed off the corruption

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:32.040
are drawn to their power if you defeat

00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:34.240
the monsters and cleanse the artifact

00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:36.319
you will get a powerful temporary buff

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:38.480
some of the Buffs make you faster others

00:52:36.319 --> 00:52:40.400
reain lightning or fire around you and

00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:42.839
some even give you increased experience

00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:45.680
or help you find better items you can

00:52:42.839 --> 00:52:47.920
also find strong boxes these enigmatic

00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:50.400
chests guard piles of treasure but are

00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:52.240
always a trap monsters lie and wait to

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:54.000
attack you the moment you open it and

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:55.920
the boxes often have mechanisms to

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:58.079
unleash powerful spells or dangerous

00:52:55.920 --> 00:53:00.160
debuffs there are different types of

00:52:58.079 --> 00:53:01.920
strong boxes containing different items

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:03.599
and you can even use your currency items

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:05.839
to craft them on the fly so you can

00:53:03.599 --> 00:53:08.880
optimize the contents but be careful of

00:53:05.839 --> 00:53:08.880
opening one you can't

00:53:15.599 --> 00:53:20.160
handle sometimes you'll discover

00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:22.319
monsters Frozen and Essences solidified

00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:24.440
crystalline corruption these dangerous

00:53:22.319 --> 00:53:26.240
monsters can be broken free if you

00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:28.200
defeat them the essence they drop can be

00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:32.000
used to upgrade normal items to magic

00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:34.760
items with a guaranteed mod from a

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:36.559
category for example we could use this

00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:37.799
one on some boats to ensure a movement

00:53:36.559 --> 00:53:39.319
speed

00:53:37.799 --> 00:53:42.319
mod

00:53:39.319 --> 00:53:44.240
nice rarely Essences will also drop that

00:53:42.319 --> 00:53:47.200
allow you to upgrade Magics to rares

00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:47.200
adding the guaranteed

00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:59.760
mod this is incredibly powerful since it

00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:02.200
allows you to get a second deterministic

00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:03.359
mod in your crafting projects combining

00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:05.000
these with the currencies that are

00:54:03.359 --> 00:54:07.640
commonly found at Ray class for

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:10.000
modifying items and we can get a very

00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:13.520
nice pair of boots

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:16.319
indeed way stones like all items can

00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:18.880
also be crafted using your currency

00:54:16.319 --> 00:54:21.040
items what the devil adding prefix mods

00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:22.319
will improve the rewards while suffix

00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:25.319
mods increase

00:54:22.319 --> 00:54:27.480
danger the more dangerous a map is the

00:54:25.319 --> 00:54:29.359
more way stones will

00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:31.040
adding mods to your waist hones is key

00:54:29.359 --> 00:54:33.200
to progressing to higher tears and

00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:35.040
sustaining them but it will require you

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:37.280
to take on larger

00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:38.599
challenges there are a variety of

00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:40.960
factors you have to consider when

00:54:38.599 --> 00:54:43.280
crafting your wones some maps will have

00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:45.720
higher density some lower some have more

00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:48.040
magic and rare chests or Monsters some

00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:49.760
are more linear and others more open

00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:51.520
make sure you explore and think about

00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:53.200
what makes certain Maps good if you want

00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:55.440
to maximize your

00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:57.520
returns as you cleanse corruption from

00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:59.240
higher and higher te of the atlas you

00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:02.000
will gain points that you can spend in

00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:04.000
the atlas tree this tree allows you to

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:06.720
juice the danger and rewards of all

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.559
areas in the end game you could increase

00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:10.839
the number of Monsters the number of

00:55:08.559 --> 00:55:13.040
rares the number of precursor artifacts

00:55:10.839 --> 00:55:14.160
or strong boxes even the quantity of

00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:16.680
item

00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:18.359
drops as you explore the endgame world

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:20.960
map you'll notice various different

00:55:18.359 --> 00:55:23.280
biomes from snowcat mountains to dense

00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:25.839
jungle valleys most maps are restricted

00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:28.000
to certain biomes as you continue to

00:55:25.839 --> 00:55:30.280
explore deeper into the atlas there are

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.920
all sorts of things to discover these

00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:33.960
cities are constructed by different

00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:35.920
peoples of Ray clust and have specific

00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:37.520
items that can be found there these

00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:39.400
strange structures marked on the map

00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:41.160
don't appear to do anything for now

00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:43.359
perhaps you'll work out how to use them

00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:46.160
later you might find unique Maps like

00:55:43.359 --> 00:55:48.319
untainted paradise an undisturbed Island

00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:50.760
full of beasts that give an extreme

00:55:48.319 --> 00:55:53.079
amount of experience you may even find a

00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:55.440
lonely man just enjoying his retirement

00:55:53.079 --> 00:55:57.480
who will give you a unique item for free

00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:59.079
in addition you can find special areas

00:55:57.480 --> 00:56:01.760
that would make a good spot to set up

00:55:59.079 --> 00:56:03.680
camp clear these areas of their hostile

00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:05.480
inhabitants and you'll be able to claim

00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:07.280
them as your own Hideout you can

00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:09.599
decorate your hideout as you see fit and

00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:13.200
invite various NPCs to join you there to

00:56:09.599 --> 00:56:13.200
create your own personal base of

00:56:13.319 --> 00:56:18.680
operations a great tool for exploration

00:56:15.799 --> 00:56:20.960
are Towers these mysterious precursor

00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:23.079
constructs are dotted around the atlas

00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:25.240
completing the tower will reveal a large

00:56:23.079 --> 00:56:27.480
area around it allowing you to scout out

00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:30.440
your next challenge there are lots of

00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:32.480
things to find so keep looking some

00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:35.000
sections of your Atlas are influenced by

00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:36.960
corruption this adds extra modifiers to

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:39.319
the maps in the region increasing

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:41.039
difficulty and rewards here slaying

00:56:39.319 --> 00:56:42.760
monsters in close proximity to each

00:56:41.039 --> 00:56:44.960
other will cause the vestages of

00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:47.400
corruption within them to merge together

00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:49.480
forming powerful and grotesque

00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:51.119
Abominations you may have noticed while

00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:53.359
looking at the atlas that some of the

00:56:51.119 --> 00:56:55.520
areas have these icons above them the

00:56:53.359 --> 00:56:58.079
icon indicates that the area contains

00:56:55.520 --> 00:57:00.160
some kind of special encounter this icon

00:56:58.079 --> 00:57:02.520
indicates that the area has a powerful

00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:04.599
boss because only one and four Maps

00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:07.559
contain a map boss we are able to make

00:57:04.599 --> 00:57:09.480
them very powerful and very rewarding

00:57:07.559 --> 00:57:11.359
these bosses come from the campaign but

00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:13.240
have had their difficulty increased with

00:57:11.359 --> 00:57:15.359
changes to Ai and some of their

00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:17.079
abilities it's worth noting that because

00:57:15.359 --> 00:57:19.400
you can see where the bosses are you can

00:57:17.079 --> 00:57:21.319
choose to take them on or avoid them if

00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:23.079
you do choose to hunt bosses though then

00:57:21.319 --> 00:57:24.799
you will be rewarded with special points

00:57:23.079 --> 00:57:26.720
for the boss hunting section of the

00:57:24.799 --> 00:57:28.720
atlas skill tree the point here will

00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:31.520
allow you to specialize in Boss killing

00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:34.720
giv greater forting them there's so much

00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:36.440
info in it it's great for each type of

00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:38.319
content in the end game we are adding

00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:40.039
specialized trees in order to make it so

00:57:38.319 --> 00:57:41.799
you don't feel the need to Respec your

00:57:40.039 --> 00:57:43.799
points when you change between different

00:57:41.799 --> 00:57:45.400
types of content we will be showing you

00:57:43.799 --> 00:57:47.039
seven of these by the end of this

00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:49.319
presentation so there is still a lot

00:57:47.039 --> 00:57:51.200
more to come bosses are not the only

00:57:49.319 --> 00:57:52.640
icon you will see on the atlas let's

00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:54.960
take a look at one of the endgame

00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:57.400
systems breach what is happening if you

00:57:54.960 --> 00:58:00.079
played poe1 you might be familiar with

00:57:57.400 --> 00:58:02.280
breach for Pee 2 we have created sequels

00:58:00.079 --> 00:58:05.079
to several pee 1 leagues while the

00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:07.920
mechanic is familiar the monsters bosses

00:58:05.079 --> 00:58:09.640
rewards and progression are all new a

00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:11.640
breach is a tear in the fabric of

00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:13.160
reality opening it will allow you to see

00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:15.119
the demons and other worldly

00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:17.440
monstrosities that lie and wait on this

00:58:15.119 --> 00:58:19.200
other plane of existence by engaging

00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:21.839
with a bridge you'll create a bridge

00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:23.520
between their world and Ray clust in

00:58:21.839 --> 00:58:25.880
order to keep the breach open you will

00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:27.880
need to kill the demons that pour forth

00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:29.640
the the faster you can kill the monsters

00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:32.000
the more monsters you will fight and the

00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:33.960
more loot you will find you can also

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:36.280
find clasped hands that will open and

00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:38.119
drop more items if you run over them

00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:40.599
these can be a good boost to the rewards

00:58:38.119 --> 00:58:43.000
of the bridge so keep an eye on

00:58:40.599 --> 00:58:44.960
them one of the rewards that you may

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.880
find while fighting monsters from breach

00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:48.400
are

00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:50.599
tablets tablets are special items that

00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:52.920
can be used with precursor Towers to add

00:58:50.599 --> 00:58:55.319
more encounters to the atlas breaches

00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:56.920
will drop breach tablets clicking on a

00:58:55.319 --> 00:58:58.920
completed Tower will allow you to

00:58:56.920 --> 00:59:01.200
consume the tablet to add more breaches

00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:03.119
to areas within range of the tower this

00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:05.559
makes all the content in the atlas self-

00:59:03.119 --> 00:59:07.760
sustaining want to do more breaches find

00:59:05.559 --> 00:59:10.200
the tablets add them to your Towers get

00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:11.760
more breaches getting more tablets soon

00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:14.559
your Atlas will be covered in other

00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:17.240
worldly domains in addition like all

00:59:14.559 --> 00:59:19.280
items in Poe you can craft them use your

00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:21.039
currency to add mods to your tablets

00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:24.240
allowing you to upgrade all the breaches

00:59:21.039 --> 00:59:26.160
in range tablets can have up to two mods

00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:28.680
these mods do things like adding extra

00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:30.559
rare monsters extra clasped hands or

00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:32.640
even monster density of breaches

00:59:30.559 --> 00:59:34.599
allowing you to keep them open longer

00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:36.599
often you will find multiple towers near

00:59:34.599 --> 00:59:38.559
to each other with overlapping areas of

00:59:36.599 --> 00:59:40.480
effect this can allow you to rarely

00:59:38.559 --> 00:59:42.160
juice the mechanic by stacking the mods

00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:44.520
from multiple

00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:46.640
tablets in your fight to hold the breach

00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:48.640
demons at back you may want to use the

00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:50.839
powers of their world against them each

00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:52.200
endgame mechanic always has player power

00:59:50.839 --> 00:59:55.039
that can only be gained from that

00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:57.559
mechanic and breach is no different in

00:59:55.039 --> 00:59:59.200
breach you will find catalysts items

00:59:57.559 --> 01:00:02.160
that can increase the quality of rings

00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:04.440
and ulet by improving specific mods you

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:05.920
can also find breach Rings a special

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:08.760
base type that can have its quality

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:10.400
improved by catalysts up to 50% in this

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:13.119
case you could create a ring with around

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:14.799
170 life breach rings can become some of

01:00:13.119 --> 01:00:16.520
the strongest rings in the game giving

01:00:14.799 --> 01:00:19.079
you some good motivation to face the

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:21.039
demon hords in addition each in-game

01:00:19.079 --> 01:00:22.880
mechanic needs to have a pinnacle ingame

01:00:21.039 --> 01:00:25.319
encounter while killing breach monsters

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:26.640
you may find breach splinters collect

01:00:25.319 --> 01:00:29.440
enough of these and you'll be able to

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:31.720
create a breach Stone using a vile

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:33.319
technology called The Realm gate you can

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:36.440
use your breachstone to access their

01:00:33.319 --> 01:00:38.280
domain and bring the fight to them in

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:40.680
this Twisted domain you will find

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:42.520
nothing but a single massive breach

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:44.839
triggering it will reveal hordes of

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:44.839
breach

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:56.400
inhabitants and should you be fast

01:00:54.680 --> 01:01:02.160
enough you will be able to fight their

01:00:56.400 --> 01:01:06.079
leader zest we that are one we that

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:11.039
Dre we in

01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:12.640
Nightmare we that our

01:01:11.039 --> 01:01:15.640
one

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:15.640
fate

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:26.160
my broken son

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:35.200
this is just one of the Pinnacle

01:01:33.079 --> 01:01:36.880
Encounters of PE to we won't be showing

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:39.400
the rest of them so you'll have to

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:40.920
discover them for yourself rest assur

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:43.079
this is some of the hardest content we

01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:45.119
have ever made all these encounters have

01:01:43.079 --> 01:01:47.520
specific uniques that can only be found

01:01:45.119 --> 01:01:50.079
from them but that's not all we still

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:52.039
have the progression system defeating

01:01:50.079 --> 01:01:53.920
zest will give you points to allocate

01:01:52.039 --> 01:01:55.960
into the breach section of the atlas

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:58.200
tree allocating these points will make

01:01:55.960 --> 01:02:00.680
breaches and the breach domain even

01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:02.400
harder but will give you more rewards

01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:04.039
the small nodes will increase the

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:05.880
difficulty of the Twisted domain while

01:02:04.039 --> 01:02:08.720
the large nodes have more specific

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:11.079
bonuses for example this node adds more

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:12.760
clasp hands to your breaches and adds a

01:02:11.079 --> 01:02:14.720
pack of magic monsters that can guard

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:16.760
them get some more points and you can

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:19.119
allocate waking nightmare which will

01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:21.680
double the number of splinters you get

01:02:19.119 --> 01:02:24.119
hands and inflict you with a mysterious

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:26.240
debuff in order to earn more points you

01:02:24.119 --> 01:02:27.960
will need to defeat zest at a higher

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:30.000
difficulty and some rewards from zesh

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:31.839
can only be found by increasing the

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.440
difficulty of the Twisted domain above

01:02:31.839 --> 01:02:36.520
certain thresholds defeating SES at

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:39.640
difficulty 4 will be a challenge indeed

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:43.039
but there are many more threats in

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:45.400
rast ritual altars are sacrificial sites

01:02:43.039 --> 01:02:47.839
built by the mysterious King in The

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:49.680
Mists if you encounter this symbol on

01:02:47.839 --> 01:02:53.039
the atlas then you know that the area

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:55.359
contains ritual altars ritual altars

01:02:53.039 --> 01:02:57.279
demand Tribute every monster you

01:02:55.359 --> 01:03:00.119
Slaughter in the circle will feed the

01:02:57.279 --> 01:03:02.799
altar after the sacrifice touch it to

01:03:00.119 --> 01:03:04.400
begin the ritual the monsters you just

01:03:02.799 --> 01:03:06.599
killed will be resurrected by the King

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:09.039
of The Mists dark magic and you must

01:03:06.599 --> 01:03:09.039
fight to

01:03:09.319 --> 01:03:13.640
survive the tribute you have offered to

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:16.599
the altar can be spent to buy powerful

01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:18.559
items but they can be expensive to gain

01:03:16.599 --> 01:03:21.160
more tribute you will want to find more

01:03:18.559 --> 01:03:23.200
altars each success of ritual you do

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:25.400
within an area will spawn the monsters

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:27.599
revived by the previous ones in addition

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:29.279
to the ones you sacrifice next to it by

01:03:27.599 --> 01:03:32.799
the end of an area you will be fighting

01:03:29.279 --> 01:03:34.839
a truly imposing number of f significant

01:03:32.799 --> 01:03:36.520
amount of Tri to spend one of the

01:03:34.839 --> 01:03:38.599
rewards you can probably grabbing the

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:40.480
favorite po1 mechan are special items

01:03:38.599 --> 01:03:42.640
that allow for metac crafting crafting

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:44.559
items that affect other crafting items

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:46.480
have an item with good prefixes but bad

01:03:44.559 --> 01:03:48.200
suffixes this Omen will help you to

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:49.880
remove the mods you don't want while

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:51.160
keeping the ones you do there are a

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:52.680
bunch more of these with different

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:55.200
effects but we will leave them for you

01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:57.359
to discover now don't forget that ritual

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:59.799
will also drop tablets which can be used

01:03:57.359 --> 01:04:01.400
to specialize into getting more rituals

if you want to get to the Pinnacle boss

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:05.119

brought Eternal Darkness to the Wildwood

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:20.400
we won't show the encounter but just

01:04:18.359 --> 01:04:22.359
like breech there are a range of unique

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:23.799

must stay within the mess to maintain

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:47.839
the nightmare which is as profitable as

01:04:45.799 --> 01:04:49.880
it is terrifying everything you kill

01:04:47.839 --> 01:04:52.039
will increase the rewards that drop

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:54.279
however the deeper into the M you travel

01:04:52.039 --> 01:04:56.359
the stronger the monsters are be careful

01:04:54.279 --> 01:04:58.119
not to overstay your welcome

rare and unique enemies will become

01:04:58.119 --> 01:05:02.760
vessels for terrifying demons who will

01:05:00.599 --> 01:05:05.319
manifest out of them to unleash powerful

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:07.760
attacks on you the Mist also offers a

01:05:05.319 --> 01:05:10.480
strange crafting material distilled

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:12.880
emotions by combining these emotions you

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:20.480
attached to your gear they are also

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:22.200
particularly great because you don't

01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:24.079
have to Traverse the tree to get them

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:25.480
allowing you to get off class bonuses

01:05:24.079 --> 01:05:27.160
that would normally be much harder to

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:29.200
get

01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:31.319
distilled emotions can also be used to

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:33.559
instill your endgame Maps applying

tablets you can find from delaria can be

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:44.440
used to further improve it increase pack

01:05:42.039 --> 01:05:45.920

of which every now and then you will

01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:55.200
find simulacrum splinters the mysterious

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:57.000
entity will create strange encounters

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:59.520
based on warped versions of your own

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:01.839
memories monsters and simulacrums come

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:03.319
in waves that get progressively more

01:06:01.839 --> 01:06:05.160
difficult you will receive loot at the

01:06:03.319 --> 01:06:07.760
end of each wave and you'll have to make

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:09.839
the decision to leave now or continue on

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:12.119
facing up against even tougher foes from

01:06:09.839 --> 01:06:15.559
the Mist the bosses you will face as you

01:06:12.119 --> 01:06:17.520
get deeper into a simulacrum are truly

01:06:15.559 --> 01:06:19.680
terrifying if you can complete a

01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:22.760
simulacrum you will gain points for the

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:26.920
delirium section of the atlas skill

01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:28.839
tree next up we have Expedition

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:31.720
occasionally while clearing corruption

01:06:28.839 --> 01:06:33.680
you will encounter these curan settlers

01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:36.359
the Cal gurans have discovered ancient

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:38.160
burial sites with lost versium artifacts

01:06:36.359 --> 01:06:41.119
and they want you to help dig them up

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:42.680
with explosives the curant have marked

01:06:41.119 --> 01:06:44.960
the locations where the relics can be

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:47.520
found Place explosives as best you can

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:49.720
to dig up as many as possible there is

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:51.119
just one problem corruption has brought

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:57.480
the corpses of their I'm not an

01:06:51.119 --> 01:06:57.480
expedition might a little reclaim theact

01:07:00.839 --> 01:07:05.039
you can also find remnants the

01:07:03.039 --> 01:07:07.279
destruction of which will further anger

01:07:05.039 --> 01:07:09.039
the Restless Dead each one you blow up

01:07:07.279 --> 01:07:11.480
will make the subsequent monsters more

01:07:09.039 --> 01:07:15.119
powerful but also more

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:17.400
rewarding danig Rog tujan and Gwyn will

01:07:15.119 --> 01:07:19.720
exchange the artifacts for useful items

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:21.400
and runic magic you can also find

01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:23.160
tablets to increase the number of

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:25.799
expeditions and the

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:28.079
rewards this one increases the radius of

01:07:25.799 --> 01:07:30.240
explosives while this one increases the

01:07:28.079 --> 01:07:33.240
number of remnants you will

01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:35.200
find eventually you might discover a log

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:37.720
book these are special Maps full of

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:40.240
berry treasure and Relics essentially

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:43.279
one giant

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:45.440
digite here you can create an extremely

01:07:43.279 --> 01:07:47.839
long chain of explosives and go through

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:50.119
a very high number of remnants but be

01:07:47.839 --> 01:07:52.960
careful many remnants have mods that can

01:07:50.119 --> 01:07:55.599
really break your build you want toid

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:57.240
these ones if you add too many remnants

01:07:55.599 --> 01:07:59.079
easily make the encounter harder than

01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:00.359
you can there are all sorts of

01:07:59.079 --> 01:08:02.200
interesting things buried under the

01:08:00.359 --> 01:08:05.520
ground in log books you might find

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:07.599
dripping caves and hidden pirate CES the

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:09.720
most powerful encounter is oloth the

01:08:07.599 --> 01:08:11.839
ancient Undead commander of the Knights

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:14.039
of the sun defeating him will grant you

01:08:11.839 --> 01:08:15.839
unique rewards as well as points to

01:08:14.039 --> 01:08:18.400
spend in the Expedition section of the

01:08:15.839 --> 01:08:20.640
atlas tree so those are the endgame

01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:22.719
systems on the atlas but we are not done

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:24.400
yet the trials we talked about earlier

01:08:22.719 --> 01:08:26.759
have much more content when you get to

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:28.719
endgame 2 just like the other endgame

01:08:26.759 --> 01:08:31.080
systems they also have progression

01:08:28.719 --> 01:08:33.719
mechanics unique rewards and player

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:35.440
power that can only be gained from them

01:08:33.719 --> 01:08:37.839
as you get higher level coins for the

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:39.640
trial of the seers you will unlock more

01:08:37.839 --> 01:08:41.799
floors to

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:44.080
explore each floor has its own

01:08:41.799 --> 01:08:46.679
challenging brooms and a floor boss that

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:46.679
you will need to

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:54.440
kill there are four floors in total

01:08:52.679 --> 01:08:56.640
leading to another Pinacle boss at the

01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:59.480
end of the last floor which can only be

01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:01.159
accessed at in the trial of the seus is

01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:03.400
where you'll find Jewels which you can

01:09:01.159 --> 01:09:04.719
socket into your tree these are like

01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:06.719
passives that you can craft with your

01:09:04.719 --> 01:09:08.480
currency items they can be really

01:09:06.719 --> 01:09:10.159
powerful as they allow you to stack

01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:12.040
modifiers that may not be easily

01:09:10.159 --> 01:09:14.000
accessible on the tree normally this

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:16.239
Jewel gives lightning damage and shock

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.199
chance for example there are quite a few

01:09:16.239 --> 01:09:20.759
Jewel sockets on the tree so it's

01:09:18.199 --> 01:09:22.359
possible to gain a lot of power here

01:09:20.759 --> 01:09:23.960
there are also other types of jewels

01:09:22.359 --> 01:09:26.080
that don't provide any bonuses

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:27.880
themselves but affect other passive

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:30.120
surrounding them this Jewel increases

01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:32.920
the effect of small nodes and radius by

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:34.719
25% with careful placement in the tree

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:36.719
you could get a significant amount of

01:09:34.719 --> 01:09:38.640
power from it there are also unique

01:09:36.719 --> 01:09:40.880
Jewels available with very interesting

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:43.359
effects but you will have to find those

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:45.440
for I that was fine in order to push

01:09:43.359 --> 01:09:47.319
further into the tri and uncover the

01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:49.600
secrets of the Marth you will want to

01:09:47.319 --> 01:09:52.000
take advantage of its progression system

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:53.799
relics relics are items that can be

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.920
placed in The Relic alter as you start

01:09:53.799 --> 01:09:58.199
the trial they give special bonuses that

01:09:55.920 --> 01:10:00.640
affect the trial making it easier and

01:09:58.199 --> 01:10:02.320
increasing its rewards of course you can

01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:04.880
craft these with your currency items

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:07.120
making them even stronger if you can

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:09.520
complete the entire trial overcoming all

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:12.120
four floors the final boss will reward

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:13.880
you with one of many unique relics these

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:15.880
relics will be consumed when used on

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:18.679
your next run but can reward you with

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:21.800
unique and Powerful items for example

01:10:18.679 --> 01:10:23.920
this is the last flame if you use it you

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:25.600
will have only one honor for the entire

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:28.600
trial so you will need to do do a

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:28.600
completely hitless

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:34.360
run the trial of chaos also extends into

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:36.560
the end game as you gain inscribed

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:38.120
ultimatums of higher and higher levels

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:40.960
the number of chambers that you can go

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:43.040
through increases in true vile style

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:45.440
this allows you to take even more risks

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:47.400
for even more rewards at end game you

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:49.320
can progress through up to 10 Chambers

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:51.400
with three bosses on a single run

01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:53.080
stacking 10 tribulations on top of each

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:55.320
other will make this a significant

01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:56.920
challenge but it's worth it the trial

01:10:55.320 --> 01:11:00.239
Master will tempt you with items of the

01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:01.920
V Empire such as V orbs V orbs are

01:11:00.239 --> 01:11:04.080
powerful crafting items that corrupt

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:06.560
your gear with random mysterious

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:08.800
outcomes corruption prevents an item

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:11.120
from being modified further so it has to

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:13.520
be the last step of your craft but it's

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:15.480
also the most impactful one for example

01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:17.920
if you use one on your body armor it

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:19.960
might add a new powerful enchantment or

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:22.440
it might roll up to half of its

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:24.800
modifiers file orbs also have the

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:26.640
ability to add a socket allowing you to

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:28.760
bypass the normal restriction of how

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:30.640
many sockets an item can have a body

01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:33.320
armor could get up to three sockets this

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:36.800
way allowing for a significant number of

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:38.400
mods file orbs can even modify uniques

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:40.040
adding enchantments or sockets to

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:41.800
uniques can make them incredibly

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:44.199
powerful but there is a good chance that

01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:46.199
you will break them as well The Trial

01:11:44.199 --> 01:11:49.080
Master will also occasionally offer you

01:11:46.199 --> 01:11:51.239
Soul cores originally formed by chaos

01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:53.639
the vile sought to replicate Soul cores

01:11:51.239 --> 01:11:55.440
through human sacrifice rituals and

01:11:53.639 --> 01:11:58.080
blood magic to power their civiliz Iz

01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:00.440
ation Soul cores are powerful socketable

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:02.360
items with mods that cannot be obtained

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:05.000
from regular

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:07.040
runes like all in-game content there is

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.679
of course a pinnacle boss the final

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:11.000
chamber will drop keys to this

01:12:08.679 --> 01:12:13.800
mysterious door some say this is where

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:16.239
the Trial Master himself resides perhaps

01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:19.040
you are willing to take the risk to find

01:12:16.239 --> 01:12:21.600
out had enough yet because there is

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:24.199
still just one more thing the most

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:25.800
difficult content in path of XL2 while

01:12:24.199 --> 01:12:27.320
mapping you might come across this

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:29.719
Fortress that has emerged from

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:32.560
underground surrounded by an enormous

01:12:29.719 --> 01:12:35.000
maze riddled with danger is the maze

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:37.080
preventing something from getting in or

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.120
something getting out this Fortress Is

01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:40.960
of ancient origin and its construction

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:42.560
has similarities to the towers and

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:44.560
tablets that you have been using on your

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:46.000
journey through the endgame it is clear

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:48.400
from the entrance that there are three

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.320
keys required to enter local factions

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.960
are vying for access to The Fortress in

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:53.840
order to seize the power they believe

01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:55.400
will be inside each of the faction's

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:57.159
leaders have managed to get their hands

01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:59.600
on one of the keys so you will need to

01:12:57.159 --> 01:13:01.880
defeat them each faction is led by an

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:03.679
Uber act boss you can see one of them

01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:05.400
inhabiting the city but in order to

01:13:03.679 --> 01:13:07.080
fight him you will first need to defeat

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:09.920
their two lieutenants in the adjacent

01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:11.840
zones be careful if you fail against

01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:13.639
either of the lieutenants or to kill the

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:15.679
leader they will move on and you will

01:13:13.639 --> 01:13:17.400
need to find them again kill all the

01:13:15.679 --> 01:13:19.760
Uber bosses and you will gain access to

01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:21.320
the Fortress we aren't going to spoil it

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:23.040
as we can't wait to see you guys attempt

01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:24.760
it for the first time but is there a

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:26.280
tree you get points in after killing it

01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:28.199
of course of course there is this is

01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:30.120
path of xile there is always another

01:13:28.199 --> 01:13:32.719
tree so these are your challenges for

01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:35.120
Pee 2 as you can see this project is

01:13:32.719 --> 01:13:37.239
crazy huge way bigger than even we

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:39.719
expected when we started out but how do

01:13:37.239 --> 01:13:41.800

Lord of augum supporter pack contains a

01:14:26.159 --> 01:14:30.159
cosmetic armor set befitting of the

count of augum himself there is also a

01:14:30.159 --> 01:14:33.159
matching back attachment which has an

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:34.880
alternate variant depicting the

01:14:33.159 --> 01:14:37.000
influence of

01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:49.000
Crowell boss found in the hunting

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:49.000
